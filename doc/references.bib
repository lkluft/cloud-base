  Abstract                 = {The second version of the atmospheric radiative transfer simulator, ARTS, is introduced. This is a general software package for long wavelength radiative transfer simulations, with a focus on passive microwave observations. The core part provides a workspace environment, in line with script languages. New for this version is an agenda mechanism that gives a high degree of modularity. The framework is intended to be as general as possible: the polarisation state can be fully described, the model atmosphere can be one- (1D), two- (2D) or three-dimensional (3D), a full description of geoid and surface is possible, observation geometries from the ground, from satellite, and from aeroplane or balloon are handled, and surface reflection can be treated in simple or complex manners. Remote sensing applications are supported by a comprehensive and efficient treatment of sensor characteristics. Jacobians can be calculated for the most important atmospheric variables in non-scattering conditions. Finally, the most prominent feature is the rigorous treatment of scattering that has been implemented in two modules: a discrete ordinate iterative approach mainly used for 1D atmospheres, and a Monte Carlo approach which is the preferred algorithm for 3D atmospheres. \{ARTS\} is freely available, and maintained as an open-source project.},
